# Vis-Tool
A tool for the visualisation of online course data. The tool makes use of the Angular JS framework for the filtering of views with the visualisations themselves created using the D3.js API. Data for the tool is retrieved in a RESTful like manner.

The tool operates on a student, group and course-concept level with an associated tab for each view. The user of the tool can filter over a number of variables before producing the required visualisation. Similarly, the data, of which a given visualisation is comprised, is also presented. Full export options for both the visualisations and data are also available.
